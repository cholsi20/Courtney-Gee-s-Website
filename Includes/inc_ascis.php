	<p>The previous server had been a Windows server, so I needed to convert the files and 
	SSI scripts to be case consistent for the new Linux server. Additionally, I needed to 
	enable the new server to read SSI scripts.</p>

	<p>I fixed many bugs which were plaguing the site, and making it more difficult 
	to use and aesthetically inconsistent.  I created consistency in header text size, 
	color palettes on each page, and appearance of the menu and the drop down lists.</p>

	<p>Currently, I am working remotely with ASCIS to completely redesign their site to meet 
	current industry demands  such as making it mobile friendly and responsive.  In the meantime, 
	check out their site!</p>
