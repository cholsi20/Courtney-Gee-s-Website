      <p>
       Courtney Gee is a woman of many trades. After earning a B.F.A. in Painting with a 
       minor in Architecture from Savannah College of Art and Design, she went on to enjoy a 
       successful seven year career in Graphic Design. From there, she decided to pursue her interest 
       in programming more seriously, and is currently on track to receive an A.S. in Computer 
       Programming from Mission College. Currently, she is working part time with clients to meet 
       their web development needs. Her goal is to become a full time Web Developer by early 2016.
