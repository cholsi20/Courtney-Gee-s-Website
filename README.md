# My Personal Website 

*What is this?*<br>
This repository reflects the state of my current website development.  Unfortunately, despite working as a Web Developer, it's more or less a side project for me. 
While I haven't had the time I've needed to put into this site what I want to, the reality is that it still remains a great place for me to test new things out, see what works or what doesnt, and stay current in my handcoded PHP skills without relying on a CMS to help me out. 
With those goals in mind, it's been pretty successful. I began developing this site before I knew how to use Git, so that should explain why there's a distinct lack of branches or anything else in this particular repository.  I'm hoping to make some pretty drastic changes to it, soon, so more to come. 

*What languages are used?*<br>
I've developed this primarily in a MAMP environment using: 
* PHP
* MySQL
* HTML
* CSS
* Colorbox (CSS Library)
* Javascript
* JQuery
